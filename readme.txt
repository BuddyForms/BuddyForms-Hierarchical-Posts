== Description ==

BuddyForms Extension for Hierarchical Custom Post Types

The Extension makes it possible to select forms as Hierarchical. Parent post = (Journal) and child post = (log)

In the Posts list of the Hierarchical Form only the parent posts (Journals) are displayed. The child pages (logs will not be displayed in the overview)

If a Journal is displayed, all child posts (logs) will be listed under the journal content.

If a user creates a new Journal he can add content like in normal posts and describe the journal.  The logs from the journal will be listed under the content

<b>Form Elements</b>

Parent Page select: to allow the user to make a log entry become a new parent.

<b>Logic</b>

If you delete a journal you delete all logs too. Delete well move the posts into trash.
