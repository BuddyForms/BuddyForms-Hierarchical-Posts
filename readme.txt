Hierarchical Posts Extension. Parent post = (Journal) child post = (log)

== Description ==

This is the BuddyForms extension for Hierarchical Custom Post Types. You need the BuddyForms plugin installed for the plugin to work. <a href="http://buddyforms.com" target="_blank">Get BuddyForms now!</a>

The extension makes it possible to select forms as hierarchical. Parent post = (Journal) and child post = (log)

In the posts list of the Hierarchical Form only the parent posts (Journals) are displayed. The child pages (logs) will not be displayed in the overview.

If a Journal is displayed, all child posts (logs) will be listed under the journal content.

If a user creates a new Journal he can add content like in normal posts and describe the journal. The logs from the journal will be listed under the content

<b>Form Elements</b>

Parent page select: to allow the user to make a log entry become a new parent.

<b>Logic</b>

If you delete a journal you delete all logs too. Delete will move the posts into trash.
