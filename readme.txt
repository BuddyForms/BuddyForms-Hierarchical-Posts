Create, manage and display hierarchical posts based on parent- and child relationships for a better user experience.

== Description ==

#### Parent to child relationship
With Hierarchical Posts you can structure your user submissions in a user friendly way. It's logic is all about parent to child relationships which means that a parent post can have multiple child posts.

WordPress can become unpleasant to write and read stories if they belong together in a hierarchical way. If you have multiple posts belonging together to one story usually you would create a category for this story and add new posts to this category to make them a part of it.

This is a nice system but can become confusing and user unfriendly if you need a much more advanced way to structure your posts. In many cases you need a more structured order within a category or between posts. With the plugin you are able to create one parent post and have its children listed above or underneath the content. The children can share the same or a different category.

#### WordPress inbuilt and fully supported in custom post types
WordPress has all functions in place to work nicely with child posts. They are used for pages and also menus (sub navigation). We have the 'get_children' function built in to gather all children posts off a parent post in one place. From there you can create custom post types. The only thing you need to do in the settings is setting 'hierarchical' to true which will enable the hierarchical functionalities.

All in all with the parent to child relationship you give your story related posts a closer binding and make them belonging together. Making the structure of posts visible makes it a lot easier for readers to understand the relationships between the posts.

#### Think of parent post as journal and the child post as log
Most off the time you don't want to display the children in the posts list. You want to display the parents and then generate a view for the children log entries. With using the plugin both viewing types are possible: displaying them separately or grouped together.

---

#### Parent post single view
All child posts can be listed under or above the content of the parent post if displayed in the single view. If a user creates a new parent post one can add any type of content just like in normal posts describing the parent (journal). The child posts (log from the journal) can be listed under or above the content.

---

#### Multiple child forms
You can create different forms for the children and enable the user to select the form he likes to use for the child posts. If you only give one form as an option, this form will be used automatically.

---

#### Form element to the select the parent
If one is selecting the parent page: allow the user to select the parent post or change a child posts parent.

---

#### Deleting a parent post
If you delete a parent journal you delete all logs too. Deleting will move the posts into trash.
